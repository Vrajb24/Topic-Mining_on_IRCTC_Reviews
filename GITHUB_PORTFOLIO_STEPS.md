## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Run Preparation Script
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/rocke/Desktop/Projects/DataMining
./prepare_for_github.sh
```
This will:
- Remove all unnecessary files
- Create professional README
- Add MIT license
- Create proper .gitignore

### Step 2: Review & Clean Git History

**Option A: Keep Existing History** (if no sensitive info)
```bash
# Just proceed to Step 3
```

**Option B: Start Fresh** (RECOMMENDED - removes ALL history)
```bash
# Remove old git history
rm -rf .git

# Initialize new repository
git init

# Configure git
git config user.email "vrajb24@iitk.ac.in"
git config user.name "Vraj B"

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: IRCTC Review Analysis System

- Comprehensive data mining system for 90,000+ reviews
- Advanced NLP with topic modeling and sentiment analysis
- Root cause analysis with pattern detection
- Interactive dashboards with real-time insights
- Automated data pipeline for continuous updates"
```

### Step 3: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Create repository with these settings:
   ```
   Repository name: irctc-review-analysis
   Description: Data mining and analysis system for IRCTC app reviews with NLP, ML, and interactive dashboards
   Public: ✅
   Initialize: ❌ (Don't add README, .gitignore, or license)
   ```
3. Click "Create repository"

### Step 4: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Add remote (use YOUR repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/Vrajb24/irctc-review-analysis.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 5: Enhance GitHub Repository

1. **Add Topics** (on GitHub repo page):
   - data-mining
   - nlp
   - machine-learning
   - python
   - streamlit
   - sentiment-analysis
   - topic-modeling
   - data-visualization

2. **Add Description**:
   "📊 Comprehensive analysis of 90,000+ IRCTC app reviews using NLP, ML, and interactive dashboards. Features automated data pipeline, root cause analysis, and live deployment."

3. **Add Website**:

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Two Separate Repos:**
   - `irctc-dashbaord` - Keep for Streamlit deployment (don't modify)
   - `irctc-review-analysis` - New clean repo for portfolio

2. **Privacy:**
   - The new repo will have NO connection to the deployment repo
   - Fresh git history (if you choose Option B)
   - Your work, your credit

3. **Live Demo:**
   - Still points to same Streamlit app
   - Just linked from different GitHub repo
