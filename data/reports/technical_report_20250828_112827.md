## 5. Contextual Pattern Analysis

### Identified Scenarios

**Peak Hour Failure**
- Occurrences: 356
- Root Cause: Infrastructure scaling during peak hours
- Solution: Auto-scaling, CDN implementation, load balancing

**Payment Loop**
- Occurrences: 116
- Root Cause: Transaction state management failure
- Solution: Idempotent payment API, better state handling

**Session Timeout**
- Occurrences: 46
- Root Cause: Short session timeout configuration
- Solution: Increase session timeout, implement session refresh

**Otp Failure**
- Occurrences: 15
- Root Cause: SMS gateway issues or delays
- Solution: Multiple OTP channels, faster SMS provider

**Search Failure**
- Occurrences: 1
- Root Cause: Search algorithm or data issues
- Solution: Fuzzy search, better indexing, data validation
